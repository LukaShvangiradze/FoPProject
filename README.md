# Project: Building a Simple Interpreter

In this capstone project, we will design and implement a simple interpreter 
for a programming language. The project will focus on creating and supporting 
a minimal subset of the language, with an emphasis on basic constructs like 
variables, arithmetic, conditionals, and iterative control flow. The interpreter 
will be capable of executing simple algorithms, serving as a proof of its functionality.
